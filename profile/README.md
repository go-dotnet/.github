> Bridging the power and design of .NET with the efficiency and simplicity of Go.

## Overview

The **go.NET** organization is dedicated to creating a Go framework inspired by the philosophy and structure of ASP.NET. Our aim is to provide Go developers with an intuitive, efficient, and powerful set of tools that merge the best practices of both ecosystems.

## Key Features

- **Service Descriptors & DI**: Dependency Injection made easy, mimicking ASP.NET's renowned mechanisms, backed by Google Wire.
- **Middleware & Routing**: Create powerful web applications with a middleware pipeline and efficient routing.
- **Configuration Management**: A robust configuration system that's extensible and developer-friendly.
- **And More**: From logging to data access, we've got a wide array of features in the pipeline.

## Getting Started

1. Install the main package:
```
go get -u github.com/go.NET/PACKAGE_NAME
```

2. Explore our documentation [here](LINK_TO_DOCUMENTATION) to dive deeper into the features and get your applications running in no time!
